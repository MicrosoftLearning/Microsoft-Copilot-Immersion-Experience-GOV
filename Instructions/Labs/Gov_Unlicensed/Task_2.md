# Task 2: Build a compelling brand using Microsoft Copilot

Using Copilot, create key identity elements by designing a logo and a concise, mission-driven tagline that embodies the essence of your service, program, or initiative.

Based on the insights and research from Task 1, this task focuses on creating branding elements that reflect your initiative’s mission and values.

## Steps

- **Create a Logo**:

    1. In **Microsoft Copilot**, copy and paste the sample prompt into the prompt field:

        ```text
        Create a clear and professional logo for a/an [service/program/initiative] named [Service/Program/Initiative Name], designed to resonate with [target audience/sector]. The logo should reflect [desired qualities, e.g., innovation, reliability]. 
        ```
    
        <div style="background-color: #e0f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0078D4; margin: 15px 0;">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice. For example:
            <ul>
                <li><code>[Service/Program/Initiative name]</code> → <em>Eco-Citizen Network</em></li>
                <li><code>[target audience/sector]</code> → <em>local communities</em></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

- **Generate a Marketing Slogan**:

    With your service, program, or initiative name and logo in mind, use the following prompt to generate a mission-driven tagline:

    ```
    Generate a concise and impactful mission-driven tagline for [Service/Program/Initiative Name] that highlights its value, unique contribution to addressing [specific need], while resonating with [target audience/sector].  
    ```

    <div style="background-color: #e0f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0078D4; margin: 15px 0;">
        <strong>Note:</strong> Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice. For example:
        <ul>
            <li><code>[Service/Program/Initiative Name]</code> → <em>Eco-Citizen Network</em></li>
            <li><code>[specific need]</code> → <em>reducing environmental impact</em></li>
            <li><code>[target audience/sector]</code> → <em>local communities</em></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
