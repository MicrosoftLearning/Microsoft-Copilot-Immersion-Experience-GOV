# Task 3:  Analyze the competitive landscape using Microsoft Copilot

Using Copilot, perform a SWOT analysis of comparable offerings identified in Task 1 and develop a unique value proposition that distinguishes your proposed service, program, or initiative by addressing unmet public needs or gaps. This results in a comprehensive analysis report and a compelling unique value proposition statement aligned with your service's goals.

Using the offerings identified in Task 1 and the branding developed in Task 2, this task focuses on strategic analysis to differentiate your initiative.

## Steps

- **Analyze Comparable Offerings**:

    1. Launch your browser and navigate to [Copilot.Microsoft.com](https://copilot.microsoft.com).
    2. Sign in using your personal Microsoft account (no Copilot license required).
    3. In **Microsoft Copilot**, copy and paste the sample prompt into the prompt field:
        ```text
        Perform a SWOT analysis for the following comparable offerings in [sector]: [Offering 1], [Offering 2]. Highlight their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
        ```
        
        <div style="background-color: #e0f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0078D4; margin: 15px 0;">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice. For example:
            <ul>
                <li><code>[sector]</code> → <em>environmental protection</em></li>
                <li><code>[Offering 1], [Offering 2]</code> → <em>Replace with the names of comparable offerings found from the first task</em></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    4. Optionally, organize your SWOT findings into a table in Word or Excel for better visualization.
    

- **Develop a Unique Value Proposition**:

    1. In **Microsoft Copilot**, copy and paste the sample prompt into the prompt field:

        **Sample Prompt**

        ```text
        Based on the SWOT analysis, develop a unique value proposition for our new [service/program/initiative] idea that differentiates it from the comparable offerings and highlights its key benefits. Overview: [Service/Program/Initiative Name] - [overview/summary of service, program, or initiative]. 
        ```
    
        <div style="background-color: #e0f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0078D4; margin: 15px 0;">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice. For example:
            <ul>
                <li><code>[Service/Program/Initiative Name]</code> → <em>Eco-Citizen Network</em></li>
                <li><code>[overview/summary of service, program, or initiative]</code> → <em>A program empowering communities to adopt eco-friendly practices</em></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    1. Optionally, you can save the output of your unique value proposition to a new Word document to reference in the future.
