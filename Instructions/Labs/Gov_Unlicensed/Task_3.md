## Steps

- **Analyze Competitors**:

    1. Launch your browser and navigate to [Copilot.Microsoft.com](https://copilot.microsoft.com).

    1. Sign in using your personal Microsoft account (no Copilot license required).

    1. In **Microsoft Copilot**, copy and paste the sample prompt into the prompt field:

        **Sample Prompt**

        ```
        Perform a SWOT analysis for the following competitors in the [industry/sector]: [Competitor 1], [Competitor 2], [Competitor 3]. Highlight their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
        ```

        <div style="background-color: #e0f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0078D4; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice (e.g., replace `[industry/sector]` with `fitness` and `[Competitor 1], [Competitor 2], [Competitor 3]` with the names of your main competitors found from the first task).
        </div>

- **Develop a Unique Value Proposition**:

    1. In **Microsoft Copilot**, copy and paste the sample prompt into the prompt field:

        **Sample Prompt**

        ```
        Based on the SWOT analysis, develop a unique value proposition for our new [app/service] idea that differentiates it from the competitors and highlights its key benefits. Overview: [App/Service name] - [overview/summary of app or service].
        ```

        <div style="background-color: #e0f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0078D4; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice (e.g., replace `[app/service]` with `fitness app` and `[App/Service name]` with the name of your app or service).
        </div>

    1. Optionally, you can save the output of your unique value proposition to a new Word document to reference in the future.
