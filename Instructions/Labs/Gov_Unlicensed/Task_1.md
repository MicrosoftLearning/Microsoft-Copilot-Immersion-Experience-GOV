# Task 1: Brainstorm your idea using Microsoft Copilot

Use Copilot to develop ideas for a new government service, program, or initiative that addresses a specific public need or gap. Research similar offerings, identify relevant trends, and create a list of comparable examples.

## Steps

- **Brainstorm Innovative Ideas**:

    1. Launch your browser and navigate to [Copilot.Microsoft.com](https://copilot.microsoft.com).

    1. Sign in using your personal Microsoft account (no Copilot license required).

    1. In **Microsoft Copilot**, copy and paste the sample prompt into the prompt field:

        **Sample Prompt**

        ```text
        Can you help me create one innovative [service/program/initiative] that addresses existing public needs or gaps within [sector] and aligns with government priorities? 
        ```
    
        <div style="background-color: #e0f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0078D4; margin: 15px 0;">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice. For example:
            <ul>
                <li><code>[service/program/initiative]</code> → <em>digital literacy initiative</em></li>
                <li><code>[sector]</code> → <em>education</em></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    1. Copy your service idea into the Word document you created earlier (**Copilot Research.docx**) for easy reference as needed in the upcoming tasks

- **Conduct Market Research**:
    1. With your service, program, or initiative idea in mind, use the following prompt to research comparable offerings:
    
        **Sample Prompt**
        ```text
        Research comparable offerings for my idea: [Your Idea]. Provide a brief overview of their presence and impact within [sector]. 
        ```
    
        <div style="background-color: #e0f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0078D4; margin: 15px 0;">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Replace the text within brackets with the idea you generated earlier. For example:
            <ul>
                <li><code>[Your Idea]</code> → <em>digital literacy initiative for rural communities</em></li>
                <li><code>[sector]</code> → <em>education</em></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
    1. Copy Copilot's response into the same Word document (**Copilot Research.docx**) for easy reference.

### Key takeaways

- You learned how to prompt Microsoft Copilot to quickly generate new ideas and export responses to Word, PDF, or text files.
- You explored how to use Microsoft Copilot to conduct market research and identify comparable offerings or competitors efficiently.
