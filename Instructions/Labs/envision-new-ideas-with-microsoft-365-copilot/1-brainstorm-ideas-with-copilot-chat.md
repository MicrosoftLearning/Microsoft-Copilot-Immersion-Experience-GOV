# Task 1: Brainstorm ideas using Microsoft 365 Business Chat

Using BizChat (aka.ms/bizchat), brainstorm innovative ideas for a government service, program, or initiative. Evaluate the feasibility of these ideas by identifying their potential benefits and possible challenges.

    <strong>Note:</strong> In the instructions below, we will provide a sample prompt for each step. While you have the option to copy and paste these prompts, we encourage you to personalize them in your own style. Be creative and experiment. If Copilot doesn't give you the desired output initially, refine your prompt and try again. Remember to enjoy the process!

## Set mode in Business Chat

A toggle at the top of the Copilot user interface allows you to switch between work and web data. Both modes provide generative AI services, but they serve different purposes to help you be more productive. For this task, you’ll use **web mode**.

    <strong>Tip:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>In work mode:</strong> Copilot responses are grounded in work data available to you. Using the Microsoft Graph, Copilot can help you access organizational resources or content, such as documents in OneDrive, emails, or other data. This is where you can manage and complete tasks related to your work. You can draft emails, create documents, manage your calendar, and collaborate with colleagues directly from this mode.</li>
        <li><strong>In web mode:</strong> Copilot is grounded in data from the public web in the Bing search index. This mode combines the power of generative AI with up-to-date information from the web. It’s useful for conducting research, finding resources, and staying updated with the latest news and trends.</li>
    </ul>

## Steps

- **Brainstorm Ideas**:

    1. Open your browser and navigate to [m365.cloud.microsoft.com/chat](https://m365.cloud.microsoft.com/chat).

    1. Sign in using your Microsoft work account (Copilot license is required).

    1. In **BizChat**, ensure **Web mode** is selected, then copy and paste the sample prompt into the prompt field:

        **Sample Prompt**

        ```text
        Can you help me identify gaps in the [specific public sector or area of government services] that could be potential opportunities for a new program, service, or initiative? I’m looking for underserved needs or emerging challenges that could be addressed.
        ```

        <div style="background-color: #e0f7ff; padding: 
            10px; border-left: 5px solid #0078D4; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice (e.g., replace `[specific public sector or area of government services]` with `healthcare services` or `cybersecurity initiatives`). .
        </div>

    1. Copy the output from BizChat to a new Word document and save the file to your OneDrive account with the name **Copilot Research.docx**. The next task uses this document.

        <div style="background-color: #ffe6e6; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #ff5c5c; margin-top: 15px;"> 
            <strong>Important:</strong> Be sure to save the file to OneDrive rather than your local PC. In the next task, you’ll use Copilot in Word to create a concept based on this document, which must be saved in OneDrive for Copilot to access it.
        </div>

- **Conduct Market Research**:

    1. With your program, service, or initiative idea in mind, use the following prompt to research existing efforts or similar initiatives:

        **Sample Prompt**

        ```text
        I'd like to explore the [sector or area of government services]. What existing programs or initiatives address this area, and are there gaps that could be filled?
        ```

        <div style="background-color: #e0f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0078D4; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice.
        </div>

    1. Copy the response to the Word document you created earlier.

### Key takeaways

- In **work mode**, Copilot responses are grounded in your available work data.
- In **web mode**, Copilot uses data from the public web via Bing’s search index.
- You learned how to prompt BizChat to quickly generate new ideas.
