    title: 'Task 1: Brainstorm ideas using Microsoft 365 Business Chat'
---

Microsoft 365 Business Chat (BizChat) is the cross-app chat experience at the heart of Microsoft 365 Copilot. Accessible within the Microsoft 365 App, Outlook, and Microsoft Teams, BizChat combines the power of large language models with your content in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 Apps to make your words the foundation of a powerful productivity tool.

With AI-driven capabilities, BizChat enhances productivity in ways you might not have imagined. It can help you draft content, catch up on what you missed, and get quick answers through open prompts. BizChat also lets you summarize actions and optimize your time, unlocking new levels of creativity, productivity, and upskilling.

#### Set mode in Business Chat

A toggle at the top of the Copilot user interface allows you to switch between work and web data. Both modes provide generative AI services, but they serve different purposes to help you be more productive. For this exercise, you’ll use **web mode**.

    <strong>Tip:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>In work mode:</strong> Copilot responses are grounded in work data available to you. Using the Microsoft Graph, Copilot can help you access organizational resources or content, such as documents in OneDrive, emails, or other data. This is where you can manage and complete tasks related to your work. You can draft emails, create documents, manage your calendar, and collaborate with colleagues directly from this mode.</li>
        <li><strong>In web mode:</strong> Copilot is grounded in data from the public web in the Bing search index. This mode combines the power of generative AI with up-to-date information from the web. It’s useful for conducting research, finding resources, and staying updated with the latest news and trends.</li>
    </ul>

### Exercise

In this exercise, you'll use Use BizChat to spark creative thinking and generate at least one innovative company or product idea—real or imagined—that addresses a current market need or gap. You’ll evaluate these ideas by identifying their potential benefits and possible challenges.

<div style="background-color: #e0f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0078D4; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <strong>Note:</strong> In the instructions below, we will provide a sample prompt for each step. While you have the option to copy and paste these prompts, we encourage you to personalize them in your own style. Be creative and experiment. If Copilot doesn't give you the desired output initially, refine your prompt and try again. Remember to enjoy the process!

#### Steps

- **Brainstorm Ideas**:

    1. Open your browser and navigate to [m365.cloud.microsoft.com/chat](https://m365.cloud.microsoft.com/chat).

    1. Sign in using your Microsoft work account (Copilot license is required).

    1. In **BizChat**, ensure **Web mode** is selected, then copy and paste the sample prompt into the prompt field:

        **Sample Prompt**

        ```text
        Can you help me identify gaps in the [specific market or industry] that could be potential opportunities for a new product or company? I’m looking for underserved areas or emerging trends that could be capitalized on.
        ```

        <div style="background-color: #e0f7ff; padding: 
            10px; border-left: 5px solid #0078D4; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice (e.g., replace `[specific market or industry]` with `Artificial Intelligence industry`).
        </div>

    1. Copy the output from BizChat to a new Word document and save the file to your OneDrive account with the name **Copilot Research.docx**. The next exercise uses this document.

        <div style="background-color: #ffe6e6; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #ff5c5c; margin-top: 15px;"> 
            <strong>Important:</strong> Be sure to save the file to OneDrive rather than your local PC. In the next exercise, you’ll use Copilot in Word to create a presentation based on this document, which must be saved in OneDrive for Copilot to access it.
        </div>

- **Conduct Market Research**:

    1. With your company or product idea in mind, use the following prompt to research competitors:

        **Sample Prompt**

        ```text
        I'd like to explore the [industry or market segment] sector. Who are the key competitors?
        ```

        <div style="background-color: #e0f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0078D4; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice.
        </div>

    1. Copy the response to the Word document you created earlier.

### Key takeaways

- In **work mode**, Copilot responses are grounded in your available work data.
- In **web mode**, Copilot uses data from the public web via Bing’s search index.
- You learned how to prompt BizChat to quickly generate new ideas.
