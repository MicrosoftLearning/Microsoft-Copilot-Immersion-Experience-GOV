    title: 'Task 3: Create a presentation using Microsoft 365 Copilot in PowerPoint'
---

Microsoft 365 Copilot in PowerPoint acts as your presentation assistant, transforming your concepts into impactful slides. With Copilot, you can seamlessly convert written documents into presentation decks, complete with speaker notes and references. Starting a new presentation is as easy as providing an outline or prompt and letting Copilot do the heavy lifting. Beyond creation, Copilot also includes tools to streamline lengthy presentations and offers intuitive commands to refine layouts, adjust text formatting, and synchronize animations.

### Exercise

In the previous exercise, you used Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word to create a new product or company concept document. This document, titled **Product Concept.docx**, includes the mission, vision, values, proposed offerings, target audience, and unique value of your proposed company or product.

In this exercise, you'll use Copilot in PowerPoint to create a pitch deck designed to capture the attention of your board of directors. Emphasize the unique value proposition, market potential, and competitive edge of your business idea or product concept.

To reference the file in Copilot, this exercise will use the shared file link.

<div style="background-color: #e0f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0078D4; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <strong>Note:</strong> In the instructions below, we will provide a sample prompt for each step. While you have the option to copy and paste these prompts, we encourage you to personalize them in your own style. Be creative and experiment. If Copilot doesn't give you the desired output initially, refine your prompt and try again. Remember to enjoy the process!

#### Steps

1. Open the **Product Concept.docx** document that you saved to your OneDrive account in the previous exercise. Copy its URL by selecting the **Share** button in the upper-right corner, then select **Copy Link** from the menu.

1. Launch Microsoft PowerPoint from your browser [PowerPoint.new](https://PowerPoint.new) or use the desktop application.

1. Open a new blank presentation.

1. In the Copilot pane, select the "Create presentation from file" prompt.

1. Paste the **Product Concept.docx** link after "Create a presentation from" and select **Send**.

    The full prompt should look like:

    ```text
    Create a presentation from [Link to Product Concept.docx].
    ```

1. Copilot will begin generating slides based on the Product Concept document, providing an outline along with features like speaker notes, images, slide layouts, and a General sensitivity label.

    <div style="background-color: #e0f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0078D4; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
        <strong>Note:</strong> Generating slides may take up to two minutes, depending on the document’s complexity and number of slides.
    </div>

1. Once complete, review the slides and make any adjustments as needed. You can use the **Designer** tool to refine layouts, add or remove slides, and modify content to align with your presentation objectives. For more prompts, see the section below.

#### More Prompts to Enhance Your Presentation with Copilot

Copilot in PowerPoint offers powerful tools to optimize and enhance presentations. Use these prompts to improve the visual and structural elements of your slides, presenting your content in the most effective way:

- **Reorganize for impact**: Ask Copilot for guidance on structuring the presentation:

    ```text
    What’s the best order to present this information for maximum impact?
    ```

- **Iterate and refine**: Use Copilot to suggest specific improvements for engagement:

    ```text
    Give me specific examples from this presentation on how I can improve it for better engagement.
    ```

- **Add new content**: Have Copilot add slides to address critical aspects of your concept, such as potential challenges and strategies:

    ```text
    Add 2 slides detailing potential challenges this new product may face, and include a slide that outlines key strategies to mitigate those challenges.
    ```

Experiment with these prompts to create engaging, polished presentations while learning to iterate and enhance designs with Copilot’s intelligent recommendations.
