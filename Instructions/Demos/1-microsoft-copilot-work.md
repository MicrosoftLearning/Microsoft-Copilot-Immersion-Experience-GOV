# Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat (Work Tab)

## Demo Setup

This demo doesn't rely on any sample documents. Instead, it relies on already existing communications you may have with your peers. 

In the prompts below, you'll reference a person who you don't share confidential information with.

## Talking Points

"Within Copilot Chat running within the work scope, Copilot uses Microsoft 365 security to protect your data and runs all its services inside your organization’s compliance boundary.

Here, in the work scope, we’re enhancing Copilot with information from the Microsoft Graph. Let’s start with some basic knowledge management. Finding out where and from whom I can get information is a perennial knowledge management challenge. Let’s see who in my organization can tell me about grounding and LLMs.

Now, I’m going to ask Copilot to summarize my communications and work with one of my colleagues. I’ll ask it to organize its response by emails, chats, and documents. In the work scope, Copilot can see my email messages, calendar, chats, and documents.

Copilot is learning how to think about your calendar. It was able to process and summarize that information and give me something useful. And it includes references so I can look at that information, verify it, or get more details.

We’re always looking at prompts and finding ways to improve how Copilot works with more complex information retrieval and automation."
